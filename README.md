# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Project Requirements:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Relevant Files:

    run_alanlysis.R: performs the steps listed above, instructions below

    code_book.md: explanation of the variables in the tidy data set

    tidy_data.txt: the deliverable for the project, tidied version of the Samsung data

## Instructions:
